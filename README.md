# Product Recommendation System For An Online Retail Store.

This was a team project for Africa's First Social Payment Hackathon. My team, Team Localhost, Built a product recommendation system for an online retail store. 

Using an Apriori algorithm to find out frequent items that are bought together which are then recommended to customers. In this approach, similarities between pair of items are computed using cosine similarity metric.
